						A ticket was just assigned to you. As you click through the ticketing system, you find your heartbeat speed up ever so slightly.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>"Please don't be a templating ticket, please don't be a templating ticket..."</i>
					</p>

You readied yourself for the difficult act of leaving another ticket alone for another year when a quick glance to the left of the ticket type left you positively surprised. Instead of the terrifying name of Behemoth Inc., you find a previously unheard of name: Critter Collective. <i>Perhaps this template won't be so bad after all</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You click through the ticket.
