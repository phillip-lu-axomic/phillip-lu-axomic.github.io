						Context:
					</h2> 
					<p>
						<i>Ding!</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						A ticket was just assigned to you. As you click through the ticketing system, you find your heartbeat speed up ever so slightly.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>"Please don't be a templating ticket, please don't be a templating ticket..."</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>"Service::Template::InDesign"</i> stares back at you from the computer screen, as still as the void in your dreams.
					</p>
					<p>
						You resigned yourself to fate. You readied yourself for the difficult act of leaving another ticket alone for another year when a quick glance to the left of the ticket type left you positively surprised. Instead of the terrifying name of Behemoth Inc., you find a previously unheard of name: Critter Collective. <i>Perhaps this template won't be so bad after all</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You click through the ticket. The entire request reads as follows:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						Due to recent rebranding efforts, we would like some templates that are heavily inspired by minimalism. Please create project-based templates for us, with only the project title in it, nothing else.

						Attached is a sample.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						You click on the attached PDF. It looks like a baby made the reference entirely within Paint.
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/template_reference.png">
					</div>
					<p>
						Just a title? In a single page? This might be one of the few templates you can do, even though it's been quite a while since you've touched templating scripting. Let's see if you still remember how to do it...
					</p>
					<h2>
						Request:
					</h2>
					<p>
						Create a custom InDesign template with the following elements:
						<ul>
							<li>1 page per project</li>
							<li>Project-based</li>
							<li>Name of the project goes near the top half of the page</li> 
						</ul>
					</p>
					<h2>
						Actions:
					</h2>
					<p>
						Okay! Let's start making the template!
					</p>
					<p>
						...
					</p>
					<p>
						... Except you don't really remember much about what a template really is...Scripts? Templates? Honest you've forgotten what those words even mean.
					</p>
					<p>
						You try to recall the presentation made by sales that showcased the process of creating a template to potential clients. It went a little something like...
					</p>
					<p>
						"This is our instance of OpenAsset", the sales pitch would go."Fully cloud-based software designed from the ground up to manage your digital assets!"
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/openasset_main_page.png"/>
					</div>
					<p>
						"Let's check out the projects that we have in OpenAsset. Let's click here..."
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/going_to_project_view.png"/>
					</div>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/project_view.png"/>
					</div>
					<p>
						"... and voila! We're in project view. Wow these are really nice projects. In fact, these projects look so nice, I want to show these projects to other people! Let me just select these three, espeically slick looking projects..."
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/selecting_projects.png" />
					</div>
					<p>
						"... and let's populate one of our InDesign templates with these projects! To do so, we'll need to mouse over the InDesign template icon and populate the template we're interested in..."
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/generating_template_menu.png" />
					</div>
					<p>
						"Confirm that we want to populate the template."
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/generating_template_popup.png" />
						<img src="/images/template_00/indesign_doc_download_prompt.png" />
					<div class="full-img">
					<p>
						"... and wow! Looks like the template was created already! Let's take a look at the template."
					</p>
					<div class="full-img">
						<img src="/images/template_00/indesign_template_preview.png" />
					</div>
					<p>
						"Wow... that's clean."
