						A ticket was just assigned to you. As you click through the ticketing system, you find your heartbeat speed up ever so slightly.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>"Please don't be a templating ticket, please don't be a templating ticket..."</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>"Service::Template::InDesign"</i> stares back at you from the computer screen, as still as the void in your dreams.
					</p>
					<p>
						You resigned yourself to fate. You readied yourself for the difficult act of leaving another ticket alone for another year when a quick glance to the left of the ticket type left you positively surprised. Instead of the terrifying name of Behemoth Inc., you find a previously unheard of name: Critter Collective. <i>Perhaps this template won't be so bad after all</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						You click through the ticket. The entire request reads as follows:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						Due to recent rebranding efforts, we would like some templates that are heavily inspired by minimalism. Please create project-based templates for us, with only the project title in it, nothing else.

						Attached is a sample.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						You click on the attached PDF. It looks like a baby made the reference entirely within Paint.
