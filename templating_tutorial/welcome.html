					Alarming words from the most powerful man in the USA, don’t you think? Unfortunately, a Pew Research report revealed that the American public has increasingly echoed this sort of scientific mistrust over the last 5 years.<br>

					Some part of me balks at the idea of people so vehemently distrusting what I love. Yet as a scientist-in-training, I will readily admit that the scientific process isn’t perfect. However, there is a difference between reasonable mistrust of the scientific process and an outright rejection of all scientific findings that clash with personal beliefs. Too often, people spurn scientific conclusions because they contradict personal worldviews, perpetuating an unfounded mistrust in science and the spread of scientific misinformation.<br>
