						<h3>OpenAsset</h3>
						We provide DAM (Digital Asset Management) for our clients.
						This means that our clients use our products to store all their images, and their associated metadata. <br>
						</br>
						<h3>Clients.</h3>
						Clients. <br>
						<br>
						OpenAsset's clientele consists of mainly of AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry people.
						So the images they store are usually of construction or engineering projects. 
						From the templating perspective, the following graph shows all the relevant parts of the OpenAsset system that you'll use
						in making the templates.

					<p>
						As you'll see in the graph, clients will import images into their OpenAsset instance. 
						They'll send template requests to the customer success team who will relay it to you. <br>
						Your job as a support engineer is to write the template script, format the incoming template documents, 
						and pull the correct images + metadata and output a completed, populated template.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the next two sections we'll talk about the final document that the clients ultimately wants, and what the user experience looks like for them.
